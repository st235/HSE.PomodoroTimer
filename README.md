# Pomodoro timer

[The Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management method. 
It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, 
separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato,
after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
